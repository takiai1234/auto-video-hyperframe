 * either. Containerised and serverless callers (Docker `--docker` renders,
 * Lambda) that want a specific profile should set `PRODUCER_LOW_MEMORY_MODE`
 * explicitly rather than relying on auto-detection. Hosts whose *total* RAM
 * is genuinely <= the threshold (laptops, small VMs, small Lambda tiers) are
 * detected correctly regardless of container nesting.
